## **SQL Project: IPL Dataset Analysis**

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing **Indian Premier League (IPL)** data using SQL to derive meaningful insights. The dataset includes information on player performances, match outcomes, and team statistics. By answering a series of questions ranging from basic to advanced difficulty, the project demonstrates the power of SQL queries in extracting and summarizing key insights.

### **Objective**
To analyze IPL data and extract useful information such as top-performing batsmen, bowlers, winning margins, and team performances across multiple seasons.

### **Database Structure**
The project database consists of the following tables:  
1. **Batting Summary** - Detailed records of batsmen performances.  
2. **Bowling Summary** - Details of bowlers' statistics and achievements.  
3. **Match Summary** - Information on match outcomes, including winners and margins.  
4. **Players** - Player profiles, including roles (batsman, bowler, or all-rounder).  

### **Key Insights and Queries**
The project covers queries across **Basic**, **Moderate**, and **Hard** levels, including:  
1. List all unique players and teams in the IPL.  
2. Find top-performing batsmen and bowlers (e.g., highest strike rates, most wickets).  
3. Retrieve matches with significant winning margins (e.g., > 50 runs).  
4. Analyze player contributions in winning matches.  
5. Determine teams with the highest win percentages.  
6. Identify top players across multiple seasons.  

### **Tools Used**
- **SQL** for querying and data analysis  
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** to manage and organize data  

### **Results**
The analysis provides insights into IPL trends, such as player performance, team success, and match highlights, enabling better understanding and decision-making based on historical data.
